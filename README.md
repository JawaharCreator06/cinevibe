# CineVibe – Movie Recommendation Demo

A small, single-page movie recommendation website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Use it as a starting point or practice project for front‑end development.

## Features

- **Interactive filters**: search, genre, mood, minimum rating, and “modern titles only”.
- **Best match scoring**: each movie shows a `% match` score plus IMDb‑style rating.
- **Surprise me**: quickly get a random title as a suggestion.
- **Responsive layout**: works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **No backend required**: all data is in a small in‑memory dataset in `script.js`.

## Getting started

1. **Open the project folder** (`J:/vibe coding` in your environment).
2. Double‑click `index.html` to open it in your browser  
   – or serve it with any static server (e.g. `npx serve .`).

You can customize the movies in `script.js` by editing the `MOVIES` array.
